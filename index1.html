        <h1>I guess you cloudn't escape lol</h1>
        <p>
            heyy ˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶, I hope you're doing well. I've been thinking a lot before writing this message because it's not easy for me to put all this into words, but I prefer to be honest with you. Since we've known each other, I've realized that you've taken an increasingly important place in my life. At first, it was just friendship, but over time, I started to feel something stronger.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I really admire your way of being, your humor, and how you see the world. Every time we spend time together, I feel really good, and I think you're a unique person for me. I know that what I'm telling you might seem weird,and i took so long to say that because i didnt want to ruin our friendship but i realized that have to share my feelings with you and know urs.
        </p>
        <p>
            So here it is... I was wondering if you felt something similar, and if you'd like to explore this possibility together. Basically, would you be interested in going out with me and seeing where it leads us? Whatever your answer, know that our friendship means a lot to me and I totally respect whatever you decide.
        </p>
        <p>
            Take your time to think about it, there's no pressure. Whatever happens, I'm here.
        </p>
